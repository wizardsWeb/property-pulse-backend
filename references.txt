- we installed the prisma from the docs
- there will be file generated that is schema.prisma 
- in which we can create aur models
- we have to create a folder name - lib
- where we will create a file name prisma.js 
- in this file we will import the prisma client
- we will use the prisma client to interact with the database

    const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
        data: {
            username,
            email,
            password: hashedPassword,
        }
    })

- it will directly create the user

- every time we make changes in the prisma 

    npx prisma db push
